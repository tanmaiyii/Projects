    "The main dataset that we are working with is the amazon reviews. The main aim is to classify the reviews to be fake or real by implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both the review text and the additional features contained in the data set have been used to build and train the classifier on part of the data set. You will then test the accuracy of your classifier on an unseen portion of the corpus. \n",

    "The first task is to define a function to parse the data and preprocess the review texts. For this, the fucntions parseReview() and preProcess(text) have been defined. In the parseReview as can be seen the Id, Text and Label have been selected from the data. Followed by preprocessing the review text. The text has been tokenised into differents words and normalised while preprocessing These functions are called while reading the data from the unicode csv reader."
